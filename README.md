## Restaurant–Customer Analysis Using SQL
### 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant and customer data using SQL to uncover insights related to customer preferences, cuisine popularity, restaurant performance, and rating patterns. The analysis is designed to simulate real-world business intelligence tasks commonly performed by data analysts using relational databases.

### 🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer demographics and dining preferences

Identify top-performing restaurants and popular cuisines

Study rating patterns and customer satisfaction levels

Practice advanced SQL concepts for analytical problem-solving

### 🗂️ Database Design

The project is built using a relational database model consisting of multiple interrelated tables such as:

**Consumers** – customer demographic details

**Consumer Preferences** – cuisine and dining preferences

**Restaurants** – restaurant details and locations

**Cuisines** – cuisine information

**Ratings** – customer ratings and feedback

The database design ensures data normalization and supports efficient analytical queries.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Database**: MySQL

**Language**: SQL

**Concepts Used**:

- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

- Subqueries

- GROUP BY & HAVING

- Aggregate Functions

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, AVG OVER)

- Views

- Stored Procedures

### 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Customer segmentation based on preferences and demographics

Identification of highly rated restaurants and cuisines

City-wise and cuisine-wise restaurant performance analysis

Ranking restaurants using window functions

Creating reusable insights using views and stored procedures

### 📈 Key Insights

Certain cuisines consistently receive higher ratings across multiple locations

A small set of restaurants contribute significantly to overall high ratings

Customer preferences vary notably by location and cuisine type

Window functions help effectively rank restaurants and customers based on performance metrics
